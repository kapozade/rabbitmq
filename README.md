## Prerequisites
* .NET 7.0
* RabbitMQ (If you already installed docker on your environment you can use [docker-compose](https://github.com/kapozade/dockerfiles/tree/main/rabbitmq) to have a running RabbitMQ instance.)

You can also use any RabbitMQ instance (i.e CloudAMQP, or installed on any server). To run applications on your predefined RabbitMQ instance do not forget to change the credentials on `appsettings.json`.
